##  IE is part of a broaderr agenda of evidence-based policy making and reshaping public policy with a focus on outcomes and results.

## Why Evaluate

- Development programs and policies to change O/C
  -   raising income
  -   improving learning
  -   reducing illness
  -   reducing poverty

> Whether or not these changes are actually achieved is a cruicial public policy question, but one that is not often examined.




## {.only-reveal}
- Focus on assessing program outcomes not on measuring programs
-   IE  *evidence-based policy making*
-    shift in focus from outcomes and results , reshaping public policy
-   set and track national targets, programs managers 
-   quality, efficiency and effectiveness of policies and programs at various stages of implementation
-   ministries compete each other for finance
-   Evidence : accountability and transparency 



::: notes 
-   Growing global trend of shift : shift in focus from outcomes and results , and is reshaping public policy
-   Results not only to set and track national and international targets, but results are increasingly used by, and reuqired of program managers to enhance accountability, determine budget allocations, and guide program design and evaluation

## 

### IE at the center

- Robust evidence for 
  -   greater accountability
  -   innovation and 
  -   learning 
  
-   what does and does not work to reduce poverty and improve welfare

-   Central question : causal relationship between the program and the outcome of interest

## Questions 
-   Did saaf pani project increased access to safe water and improve health otucomes?
-   Has export promotions and duty exemptions raised export? 
-   Did a new curriculum raise test scores among students? 
-   Was NIC and BIC successful in fostering entrepreneurship and raising income?

> In each of these questions, IE provides information whether the program caused the desired outcomes as contrasted with specific case studies or anecdotes. 

## 

  > Well designed and well-implemented IEs are able to provide convincing and comprehensive evidence that can be used to inform policy decision, shape public opinion and improve program operations.
