The `{tidyverse}`  data manipulation functions have been a boon to analysts' productivity. The `{tidyverse}` itself contains several packages designed to work together in a consistent, logical, and human-friendly fashion.

# Introduction



## One-stream data manipulation]

|function |action |
| :--- | ---: |
| filter()    | *keep rows (if true)*|
| select()    | *keep variables (or drop them `-`var)*|
| mutate()    | *create a new variable*|
| case_when() | *is used for "recoding" variable, often used with mutate()*|
| rename()    | *renaming variables*|
| arrange()   | *order rows based on a variable*|
| slice()     | *keep or drop rows based on row number |


## Logical operators (booleans)

Especially in filtering, you are likely to use Boolean operatores `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, which make a comparison and return `TRUE` or `FALSE`.  These can also be combine with `&` (both conditions must be met), `|` (either condition may be met), or `%in%` (if the left hand side element is found *among* the right hand side elements, `TRUE` is returned).


# Summarizing

|function |action |
| :--- | ---: |
| summarize() | *summarize the data, by groups if they have been declared*|
| group_by()  | *declare subsets in data*|
| distinct()  | *returns only rows that are unique*| 
| tally() & count()     | *counting (by groups if group_by() applied)*|


Base-R functions that you are might use in summarizing include `mean()`, `median()`, `sd()`, `IQR()`, `min()`, `max()` etc.

The function `summary()` can also be used to request summary statistcs for an entire data set. 

# Shape transformation (wide <---> long)
|function |action |
| :--- | ---: |
| gather() or pivot_longer() | *from wide to long*|
| spread() or pivot_wider() | *from long to wide*|


# Bringing streams together: Joins and Binds

|function |action |
| :--- | ---: |
| full_join() | *keeps all rows*|
| inner_join()  | *keeps overlapping rows*|
| left_join()  | *keeps all left-hand side rows*| 
| right_join()     | *keeps all right-hand side rows*|
| anti_join()     | *removes rows if there is a match on right-hand side*|
| crossing()    | *for each left-hand side row, include the entire data set of the right-hand side*|
| bind_rows()   |  *stack datasets, finding consistent column names* |
| bind_cols()   |  *glue datasets together side-by-side* |



## [Data Cleaning](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/data_cleaning/data_cleaning){target="_blank"}

I personally think of data cleaning as a separate, but related topic to data manipulation - which is the central topic of the present resource.  A separate data cleaning resource can be found [here](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/data_cleaning/data_cleaning).

- Regular Expressions, character string manipulation with `{stringr}`
- Unique Identifiers for Countries with `{countrycode}`
- Date Manipulation `{lubridate}`

## [Data Visualization with {ggplot2}](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot2_grammar_guide/ggplot2_grammar_guide){target="_blank"}

Another part of the `{tidyverse}` not covered here is `{ggplot2}` the popular data visualization package authored by Hadley Wickham and contributors.   

## [Cool with Statistical Independence](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/statistical_independence/statistical_independence) 

This a resource we've looked at for thinking about what strength of relatshionships we might observe just by chance.
