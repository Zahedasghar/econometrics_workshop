## Course Overview 

This couse is designed to enable [participants to focus on research design]{.yellow}, [thinking clearly with data]{.yellow} and learn [program/impact evaluation tools]{.yellow} with real life data applications through computer-based exercises and learn to replicate the results of published economics articles like Card and Krueger (1994). Philosophy of the course will be to engage participants in doing program evaluation through computer assisted tools. [Main software for the course will be STATA and R]{.yellow} with all programs/slides available for each topic after the training. Following are books for the training. 

-   [Mastering metrics: Path from cause to effect By Noble Laureate](https://www.masteringmetrics.com/)

-   [The Effect](theeffectbook.net)

-   [Impact Evaluation in Practice](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/sief-trust-fund/publication/impact-evaluation-in-practice)

## [Objectives of the workshop]{.yellow} {.scrollable}

-   Learning tools for program evaluation :Randomization, IV, DID, RDD and Matching 

-   Use of Health Insurance Subsidy Program data with application using STATA and R 

-   Reproducing some well know published articles including noble laureates

-   Read, understand, and evaluate empirical studies on program evaluation

By the end of this course, participants will be familiar with tools to be applied for program evaluation and better understand research design.
