# Introduction

This training workshop is designed to focus on research design, thinking clearly with data with real life data applications through computer-based exercises and learn to reproduce the econometric results of published economic articles like Card (Nobel Laureate) and Krueger (1994). Philosophy of the course will be to enable participants in doing economics. Main software for the course will be R, and STATA with programs will also be provided for many of the topics. This course will




```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::write_bib(c('posterdown', 'rmarkdown','pagedown'), 'packages.bib')
```

## Objectives

1. Emphasis on understanding problem solving techniques, rather than mathematical theorems and complex proofs

2. Developing a learning community to improve statistical and econometric skills necessary in the study of economics.

3. Some of the resources to be used for this course and freely available are listed as follows:

## Results

```{r, irisfigure, fig.cap='Here is a caption for the figure. This can be added by using the "fig.cap" option in the r code chunk options, see this [link](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#plots) from the legend himself, [Yihui Xie](https://twitter.com/xieyihui).', out.width="80%"}
par(mar=c(2,2,0,1))
plot(x = iris$Sepal.Length, y = iris$Sepal.Width,
     col = iris$Species, pch = 19, xlab = "Sepal Length",
     ylab = "Sepal Width")
```

Maybe you want to show off some of that fancy code you spent so much time on to make that figure, well you can do that too! Just use the `echo=TRUE` option in the r code chunk options, Figure \@ref(fig:myprettycode)!

```{r myprettycode, echo=FALSE,collapse=TRUE, fig.cap='Boxplots, so hot right now!', fig.height=3.5, out.width="80%"}
#trim whitespace
par(mar=c(2,2,0,0))
#plot boxplots
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Width~iris$Species,
        col = "#008080", 
        border = "#0b4545",
        ylab = "Sepal Width (cm)",
        xlab = "Species")
```

How about a neat table of data? See, Table \@ref(tab:iristable):

```{r, iristable}
knitr::kable(
  iris[1:8,1:5], format = "html",
  caption = "A table made with the **knitr::kable** function.",
  align = "c", col.names = c("Sepal <br> Length",
                             "Sepal <br> Width",
                             "Petal <br> Length",
                             "Petal <br> Width",
                             "Species"),
  escape = FALSE)
```
